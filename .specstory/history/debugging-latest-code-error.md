_**Assistant**_

To address the latest error regarding the type of `error` being `unknown`, you can explicitly type the `error` variable in the `catch` block. This will allow you to access the `message` property safely. Here's the updated code snippet:

```language:app/api/fetch-metadata/route.ts
// ... existing code ...
  } catch (error: unknown) {
    console.error("Error fetching metadata:", error)
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Failed to fetch metadata", details: (error as Error).message }, { status: 500 })
// ... existing code ...
```

### Explanation of the Update:
- The `error` variable in the `catch` block is explicitly typed as `unknown`.
- The `details` field in the JSON response now safely casts `error` to `Error` to access the `message` property. This resolves the TypeScript error regarding the type of `error`.
