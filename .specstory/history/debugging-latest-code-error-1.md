To address the latest error regarding the type of `error` being `unknown`, you need to ensure that you cast `error` to `Error` before accessing its `message` property. Here's the updated code snippet with the necessary change:

```language:app/api/fetch-metadata/route.ts
// ... existing code ...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching metadata:", error)
{{ edit_1 }}
// ... existing code ...
}

// Change this line:
{{ edit_1 }}
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Failed to fetch metadata", details: (error as Error).message }, { status: 500 })
// ... existing code ...
```

### Explanation of the Update:
- The line that returns the JSON response in the catch block has been updated to cast `error` as `Error` to safely access the `message` property. This resolves the TypeScript error regarding the type of `error`.

To resolve the import error regarding `cheerio`, you need to adjust the import statement. The error indicates that `cheerio` does not have a default export, so you should import it as a named import. Here's the updated code snippet with the necessary change:

```language:app/api/fetch-metadata/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server"
// Change this line:
import * as cheerio from "cheerio"
// ... existing code ...
```

### Explanation of the Update:
- The import statement for `cheerio` has been changed to use a named import (`import * as cheerio from "cheerio"`). This resolves the import error by correctly importing all exports from the `cheerio` module.
